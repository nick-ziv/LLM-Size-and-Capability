# LLM-Size-and-Capability

In this into, I cover the story of my experience which led to this article. Scroll to the bottom for the size-to-capability chart.

Through experimentation, I began to realize that models of smaller size really struggle with certain tasks. 

(I will leave actual sizes undefined as required model size always varies with problem complexity)

Naturally, my approach was to engineer a solution to precisely control the context the small model received as input. Employing the full range of prompt engineering techniques, I tried everything under the sun… and then the moon… and then the sun again! 

Nothing was working - until I pasted my small model's input into a foundation model and pressed enter. After what seemed to be the shortest amount of 'thinking' I had ever seen: a perfect response.

...

When working with small models, Problems often need to be broken down into very small steps, with complicated prompting techniques often overcoming the limitations. My research led me to desire a quick reference of model capabilities at certain sizes. This table, generated by Grok, shows common model sizes and their expected capabilities. 

This is not a definitive guide as models continue to come out which bring capabilities to smaller sizes frequently.

| Size | Capability |
| --- | -------- |
| 1B | Basic text completion and pattern recognition. Models can generate simple sentences with reasonable grammar but lack coherence over longer passages. Limited to rote memorization of common phrases without understanding context or nuance. |
| 4B | Improved coherence in short paragraphs. Basic question-answering on straightforward topics. Simple creative tasks like generating rhymes or basic stories. Still struggles with factual accuracy and complex syntax. |
| 8B | Decent conversational abilities, including chit-chat and basic instruction following. Improved handling of common knowledge recall. Basic coding assistance for simple scripts. Emergent simple few-shot learning for pattern-based tasks. |
| 12B | Enhanced factual recall and better handling of diverse topics. Simple reasoning tasks, like basic analogies. Improved code generation for routine functions. Start of in-context learning for uncomplicated prompts. |
| 20B | Stronger creativity in writing, such as generating short stories or poems with structure. Better multi-turn dialogue. Basic math solving with explicit steps. Improved performance on benchmarks like commonsense QA. |
| 30B | Few-shot learning becomes more reliable for a wider range of tasks. Basic multi-step reasoning with prompting. Coding for moderately complex problems. Reduced hallucinations in factual responses. |
| 50B | Robust in-context learning without fine-tuning. Advanced coding capabilities, including debugging simple code. Emergent abilities in word puzzles and basic arithmetic. Better generalization to unseen tasks. |
| 70B | Chain-of-thought reasoning for complex problems, like math word problems. Instruction-tuned models excel at following user directives. Human-like performance on many NLP benchmarks. Strong multilingual capabilities. |
| 100B | Sudden jumps in solving abstract puzzles and logical reasoning. Emergent zero-shot learning for unfamiliar tasks. High proficiency in creative tasks, such as writing in specific styles. Improved truthfulness and calibration. |
| 120B | Enhanced consistency in long-context understanding. Better handling of ambiguous queries. Advanced few-shot translation between languages. Start of emergent behaviors in strategic tasks like basic game playing via text. |
| 150B | Robust multi-step reasoning without explicit prompting. High accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks. Emergent coding for full programs. Better mitigation of biases through scale. |
| 200B | Near-human performance on broad benchmarks like MMLU. Emergent abilities in grounded reasoning and fact-checking. Creative generation of novel ideas or hypotheses. Stronger self-correction mechanisms. |
| 300B | Advanced emergent abilities in multilingual and cross-cultural understanding. High-level math and science problem-solving. Potential for basic agentic behavior in simulated environments. Reduced need for extensive prompting. |
| 500B | Reasoning abilities rivaling experts in specific domains. Emergent synthesis of information from diverse sources. Handling of very long contexts (e.g., book-length). Hypothetical unlocks in novel task generalization, like inventing simple algorithms. |
| 750B | Frontier-level performance with minimal hallucinations. Emergent creative problem-solving in unseen scenarios. Potential for meta-learning, adapting quickly to new paradigms. Enhanced emotional intelligence in responses. |
| 1T | Hypothetical: Near-AGI capabilities in language domains, including complex simulations and planning. Emergent world modeling for predictive tasks. Seamless integration of multimodal understanding if trained accordingly. |
| 1.5T | Hypothetical: Advanced emergent phenomena like spontaneous analogy-making across disciplines. Superior long-term memory simulation. Potential unlocks in ethical reasoning and value alignment without explicit training. |
| 2T | Hypothetical: Pinnacle of current scaling paradigms, with emergent abilities approaching general intelligence in text-based interactions. Novel insights generation, such as scientific hypotheses. Robust handling of adversarial inputs and edge cases. |

This chart was generated using Grok.  A disclaimer Grok added:

Note: These capabilities are based on observed trends in scaling laws and known models up to around 500B parameters (e.g., GPT-3 at 175B, PaLM at 540B). Larger sizes are extrapolations, as real-world models beyond this are speculative or not publicly detailed as of 2025. Emergent abilities have been debated; some research suggests sharp jumps are metric artifacts, with performance scaling more smoothly when measured granularly.

I hope this helps!
